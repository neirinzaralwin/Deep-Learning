In this project I practiced U-NET architecture for Image Segmentation.

    CREATE saved_images folder in your directory

> used Jupyter Notebook in anaconda
> used Pytorch
> used Cavana Image Masking Challenge's dataset in Kaggle

 HOW I USE DATASET
-> I downloaded Train and Train_masks dataset because the whole dataset is so big, nearly 24 GB. Then I split train and validation data from train and train_masks dataset.
-> validation datasets size is about 96 image.
